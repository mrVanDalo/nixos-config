# My nixos configuration

This folder belongs to :

```
/etc/nixos/
```

than you run `nixos-rebuild switch` and you have my configuration.

## notes

* `filesystem.nix` is basically the adapted version of `hardware-configuration.nix` which can be generated.
* when you run `nixos-install` make sure the `/boot` folder is mounted.
